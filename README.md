## 🌟 Problem Statement
While GPS works well for outdoor navigation, indoor positioning remains a challenge for the visually impaired. This project introduces a smart blind stick that memorizes indoor paths and provides enhanced safety features.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 🗺️ Path Memorization
- Indoor path recording and playback
- Reference point marking
- Turn-by-turn guidance

### ⚡ Safety Features
- Ultrasonic obstacle detection
- Emergency alert system
- Real-time location sharing with relatives
- Audio feedback through beeping signals

### 📍 Location Services
- Indoor position tracking
- Emergency GPS coordination sharing
- Last known location storage

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Hardware Components (Simulated)
- Ultrasonic sensors
- GPS module
- Emergency button
- Microcontroller
- Buzzer for alerts

### Software Requirements
- Proteus Professional (Latest Version)
- Required Libraries:
  - GPS Module Library
  - Ultrasonic Sensor Library
  - Path Memorization Module
